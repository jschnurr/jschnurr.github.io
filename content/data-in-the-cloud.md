Sometimes I think that people regard the “cloud” as magical. They look
up into the sky, reflect on nature’s beauty, and ponder the wonders of
hosted applications and data. How carefree it is to move bits around
using only a browser from anywhere, confidently knowing those bits will
always be there, just a click away. It’s effortless and beautiful.

Unfortunately, the cloud isn’t magic. While you might struggle to wrap
your arms around a real cloud high up in the sky, there is no such
struggle with your Facebook or Gmail data. That cloud is really just a
rack of servers and storage, in a real datacenter, in a real city,
administered by a real team of people, working for a real company.

As companies come and go over time, or decide to retire services as
[Yahoo tried to do with
Delicious](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/yahoo-may-shut-down-some-services/),
I wonder what will happen to all of that data. Will I need to move it to
new services subsuming the old, will I choose to just let the data go,
or will this simply never become a real problem?

Perhaps I’m a little out of the norm here, in that I value my digital
archive. I still have all of my old personal documents from 20 years
ago, and I just keep appending every year as life adds new twists and
turns. Sometimes, those old documents serve purposes beyond nostalgia -
they can settle disputes, avoid re-work, or recover abandoned projects.

Perhaps someone will create a service that harvests my cloud-based
personal content, translates it into an open format, and gives me a
physical copy. Or, more likely, I’ll place all of my chips with one
“data cloud” provider, and insist that the other services I use store
their data there, so at least I know it’s all in one location.

In any case, if you’re looking for a precision-tweaked Zmodem file for
[Telix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telix), I still have mine. Just
ping me.
