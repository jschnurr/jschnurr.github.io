[dropcap color="\#1e73be" boxed="yes" boxed\_radius="8px" class=""
id=""]W[/dropcap]aterloo is a wonderful city.  A balance of country and
the city, full of diversity and culture, and teeming with technology and
innovation prowess that is truly world class.  Having already changed
the world with the BlackBerry, Waterloo stands ready to do so again with
a start-up ecosystem already [ranked \#16 in the
world](http://www.techvibes.com/blog/vancouver-toronto-and-waterloo-rank-among-top-10-startup-ecosystems-in-world-2012-11-20).

Not satisfied with that, the community continues to invest, fueled by a
decidedly small-town ethos that promotes cooperation, resource pooling,
knowledge sharing and mentoring.  The focus is not on individual gain,
but on the growth of the ecosystem.  It's like the environment is
purpose built to attract altruism and repel egos.

So how do you "plug in" to this ecosystem?  You could create or join a
start-up, but that's not the only way.  Let's look at what this
environment has to offer.

**Hubs**  
There are 3 major hubs around which the community gathers.

1.  [Communitech](http://www.communitech.ca/about/).  With a mission
    to help tech companies start, grow & succeed, Communitech offers
    programs, events, services, information, networking and more.  It's
    a one-stop shop.
2.  [Accelerator Centre](http://www.acceleratorcentre.com/about_us).  A
    world-class incubator, with physical premises and on-site support
    services for companies accepted into the environment.
3.  [Velocity](http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/campus/about).  Part of the
    University of Waterloo, Velocity helps entrepreneurially-inclined
    students start companies.

For each of these, consider following their social media streams,
signing up for events, and visiting the website regularly.  These guys
know start-ups, and they have outstanding community outreach.

I hope that's enough to get you started.  I would also encourage you to
review your LinkedIn connections, and look for people active in the
ecosystem already, and reach out to them.  I think you'll find they will
be quite willing to join you for a coffee and chat.

Lastly - please let me know if I've missed anything!  There is so much
to cover, I've tried to be selective, but I'm open to revisions based on
feedback.
