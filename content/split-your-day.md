respected leaders know how to deliver results, both short and long term.
How should you allocate your time in the interest of both time horizons?
Try splitting your day.

The “results” half is all about shipping stuff now. Its sleeves rolled
up, amidst the team working to produce a result we can see from here.
The team sees the leader as a colleague, and the bond strengthens as the
team works something together. The reward is a direct output of the
effort put in, and the link is obvious.

The “capability” half is all about the enduring capacity of what you’ve
built to persist without you, scale well, and deliver output
disproportionate to the input over time. These are the truly strategic
plays, the activity that doesn’t always look obvious or valuable to
those unfamiliar with the strategy.

Its a good day when you can get both from the same work. Try coaching a
promising new leader through a tough assignment, working through a
complex activity ad-hoc while developing a new process that makes it
repeatable, or visiting a frustrated customer to both bring resolution
and learn how to fix the cause.

If you’re only working on results, you can’t scale beyond the hours you
have in a day. If you’re only working on capability you’re just a suit
disassociated from the people doing the work. A balance of both is where
you want to be.
