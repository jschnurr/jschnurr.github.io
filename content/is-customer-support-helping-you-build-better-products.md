Every department needs to think about value creation, and how to make
the company stronger.  In Customer Support, value is created when a
customer has a great service experience, and a problem is resolved.
 That effort results in a positive customer experience today, but how
can it be leveraged to enable a better experience tomorrow?  The REP
model (respond, empower, and prevent) provides a way to think about
Customer Support value creation beyond the interaction.

The REP model is a process, with the output of each stage becoming the
input for the next.  Flowing through this process are individual
*service needs* - each one unique in its own right, and possibly
experienced by many customers.  For example, a customer request for an
*order status* is a single and unique service need, with a defined scope
and method of resolution.  If three customers request an *order status*,
it's still only **one** service need, delivered **multiple times**.

It's important to define service needs in the customer context.  *Reset
router* is not a service need, but the action you take to resolve it.
 Customers report they c*an't access web pages - *that's the service
need.

Each service need has a lifecycle:

1.  Creation - the day the service need was born.  Maybe it was a defect
    in a shipped product, a new process that customers don't understand,
    or a fix for another problem with an unintended consequence.  In any
    case, the natural flow of product use becomes interrupted for the
    customer, and cognitive load is created when they must stop and
    ponder the best way to remove some friction.
2.  Optimization - by now the service need has a defined scope, some
    awareness, and perhaps a name or tracking identifier.  A process
    exists to workaround or resolve the need, and multiple instances are
    handled in a similar way.  If the frequency is high enough,
    knowledge content or tools are created, and the cost of each
    instance comes down, while resolution time improves.
3.  Elimination - when the root cause is designed out, and the customer
    no longer experiences that cognitive load in the first place.
     Perhaps a new product release fixes a bug, or a confusing UI is
    simplified with better input validation.  Whatever the case, the
    issue has lost all relevance - it just doesn't exist.

The REP model pairs Support team tactics to each phase of the service
need lifecycle:

1.  **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respond</span>**.  When
    a new service need is created and a customer brings it to our
    attention, we react.  An efficient Tier 1 team quickly identifies
    the issue as unfamiliar, and escalates it up the chain.  Diagnostics
    are collected, workarounds created, and each customer is taken care
    of, one by one.  This is the most recognizable and managed aspect of
    the Support function, and the traditional role of the Contact
    Center.  The treatment of each customer during the process will be
    critical, as we attempt to create customer satisfaction by
    demonstrating how well we react.
2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Empower**</span>.
     Service needs we've seen before don't need the same level of
    engagement.  The focus is on empowerment - taking the best available
    information about the service need and making it easily accessible
    to the customer.  It may be knowledge content, an insert shipped in
    the box, or a new tool on the website.  The customer still has the
    service need, it's just easier, faster and less expensive to resolve
    it.
3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Prevent**</span>.  This
    is where the Support team runs out of gas, and engineering needs
    to step in.  The evidence produced in the Respond and Empower phases
    come together as a meaningful dataset, with actionable insight that
    the engineers can work from.  The Support team stands willing and
    able to support the process - producing helpful qualitative
    feedback, recommendations and design input.

You can imagine this as an assembly line, with raw materials (new
service needs) constantly entering the system, being processed through
the Respond, Empower & Prevent stages, and producing eliminations of the
service need as output.  While the Support team is constantly dealing
with service needs at different stages in the process, it's the
efficiency and quality with which the whole process is managed that
determines the level of value add.

Fully optimized, the REP process is a virtuous cycle of continuous
improvement.  Customer Support becomes a strategic point of intelligence
collection, helping the organization understand customer pain points and
produce direct remedies in near real-time, leading to better products
and happier customers.

Now that's value creation.
