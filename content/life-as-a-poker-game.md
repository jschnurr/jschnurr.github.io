A few years ago, I learned how to play poker. Since then, I’ve continued
to practice and study the game, learning the techniques, nuances and
strategies that win. While I’m still an average player, I keep getting
better.

What I find interesting is the extent to which poker represents a model
for the way one interacts with the world as a whole. Life serves up
random situations, not unlike the randomness of cards dealt around the
table. People study their own situation and apply their own motivations
relative to that situation, and act in their own best interests. Your
job is to not only make the best of the hand you’re dealt, but study the
other people and try to figure out how they’re approaching the
situation, and why.

The bets and raises represent the extent to which you have an interest
in the situation, and as the stakes get higher you rightly up your level
of engagement to match. Sometimes you find yourself “pot committed”, and
you’re still playing because you’re already in too deep to back out.
Other times, something about the situation tells you it’s time to fold,
for reasons that may or may not be related to your own interest in the
situation.

Of course, life is full of altruism, collaboration, teamwork and many
other drivers that contradict the metaphor. However there are, as they
say, no friends at the poker table.
