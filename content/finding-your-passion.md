[fusion\_text]I've been doing some soul searching, trying to isolate
exactly what lies at the nexus of my interests & abilities.  There is a
long list of functional skills, but those come and go over time.  There
are competencies, which are constantly being evaluated and refined, as I
gain more experience and learn from new situations.

What I'm after, however, isn't either of those - it's my true passion,
the core concept that unifies my strengths, values, interests and
abilities.  The thing I get excited about, the thing I'm good at.  The
enduring idea that can apply to many different roles & situations.  What
is it?

I've done the evaluations (I'm an ENTP in Myers-Briggs, high D in DISC),
read the books, and tried to work this out methodically, but really
didn't get there.  Then, while writing an email, it just sort of popped
out, and I recognized it instantly.

That's it.  It might be an internal customer, or external customers.  IT
project delivery or technical support.  Software development or
infrastructure, network or security engineering - across all of it,
that's the golden thread that ties it all together.

Wicked-smart people inspire me to be at my best, and keep me challenged,
so I seek them out to join the team.  Technology is my natural setting -
I'm a geek at heart.  And customer centricity, or the idea that any
business endeavour is ultimately aimed at making customers happy, is
just how I'm wired.

Simple, isn't it?

Ok, so what's your passion?
