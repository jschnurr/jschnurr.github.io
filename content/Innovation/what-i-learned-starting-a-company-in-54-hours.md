On Friday night, 100 developers, designers and business people came
together at the [Communitech
Hub](http://www.communitech.ca/connect/the-communitech-hub/) in
Kitchener to start a company.  The event was called [Startup Weekend
Kitchener/Waterloo](http://kw.startupweekend.org/), part of the global
movement of the same name that now includes over 45,000 Startup Weekend
alumni, from cities around the world.  The mantra is "No talk, all
action", and the objective is to launch a Startup in 54 hours,
culminating in a pitch on Sunday night to community investors and
business leaders.

This was my first Startup Weekend, and in fact my first Communitech
event.  Overall, I felt very fortunate to be amongst such a diverse and
capable group of people - both the participants that rolled up their
sleeves to build something, but also the vast network of community
leaders and experts (Communitech calls them 'Mentors') that are freely
available to help you make it happen.  It's a beehive of brainpower,
caffeine and pure focus.

Forming a Team
--------------

On Friday night, the event was opened with some inspiration from Matt
Gardner and Jason Moore ([Groupnotes](https://groupnotes.ca/)), Ted
Livingston (founder and CEO of [Kik](http://kik.com/)), Melissa Morgan
(CEO & co-founder, [uIntuition](http://uintuition.com/)) and Ramzi
Samara (MBET and Startup Weekend KW winner).  Each are successful
entrepreneurs in their own right, with a lot to share for this eager
young audience.

Next, the pitches started.  Anyone could pitch, and they were given a
microphone and 60 seconds to sell their idea to the crowd.  The next
step was voting, where each member of the audience placed sticky notes
on the ideas that most captivated them - and that they would most like
to work on.  When the dust settled, there were about 10 ideas selected,
and the crowd self-organized around those ideas to build teams for the
weekend.

I joined a team that had merged two related ideas together - the ability
to more easily find sports fields using annotated mapping, and an easier
way to find pick-up games of your favorite sport nearby.  The team had
started to form and was missing the "business guy" role, so they asked
me to help.  I was in!

The Setup
---------

The first few hours were all about logistics.

We introduced ourselves (we had never met before), shared a bit about
our backgrounds, and determined what role each person would play.  We
shuffled tables and chairs into a comfortable workspace, set up the
laptops, and put there whiteboards within easy reach.

From a technology perspective, there was a rapid consensus on the
technology stack.  We selected a domain & hosting provider, mobile
development platform, languages, libraries, databases and interfaces.
 We set up a project in [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize
activity, and talked about the high level milestones for the weekend.

![logo2](<{filename}/images/startupweekend/logo2-300x122.png>){.pull-right}

We sketched out a bunch of wire frames in a notebook to illustrate the
concept.  In all, we had 7 screens that embodied the concept, and
provided the major workflows for our MVP - minimum viable product.Then,
came the name.  We needed an identity - and a clear, consolidated vision
of the two ideas we had formed from.  After much debate, it was decided
- [gameIt](http://gameit.launchrock.com/) was born.

It was midnight Friday night, and Communitech was closing the building.
 You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.  We decided a fresh
start on Saturday would be best, and wrapped for the day.

The Concept
-----------

Communitech opened at 8am, and the team trickled in shortly after that.
 We quickly decided our workspace was too crowded, and relocated
downstairs to a more open area where we could breathe.  Breakfast was
served, and then we got down to work.

We had to refine the business concept.  The wireframes gave the
development team enough to chew on for a few hours, and they started to
put the plumbing together.  In parallel, we began work on the brand and
business model.  What business were we in?  Who were our customers?  How
would we make money?

This was a very iterative process.  The core idea, and the features and
the functions of the app, all came very quickly, and didn't change much
over the course of the weekend.  How to translate that into a business,
however - was a much bigger challenge.

The Mentors
-----------

Throughout the weekend, we had the support and input from a number of
mentors along the way.  It was great to work with such a capable and
diverse set of people, all with no agenda but to advance our idea.
 Their feedback, brutally honest and seasoned with reality - kept the
team aligned.  It also caused turbulence, as inputs varied and
conflicted.  In the end, it was on us to synthesise the inputs, make
decisions and converge on a plan.

The Output
----------

After two days of intense development, strategy, branding, business
planning, market research and pitch deck creation - it was time.  On
Sunday night, it all came together.   This is what it sounded like, on
stage in front of our fellow Startup Weekend participants, mentors, and
of course - the [judging panel.](http://kw.startupweekend.org/#judges)


<div class="well" markdown="1">
Everybody wants to be healthy. We
need to harness the power of technology to get people outside, and
re-engage in what we would call retro-social - before Twitter and
Facebook, when you would gather with your friends and get out on the
pitch.

Our target market is active, young professionals.  While they play in
organized leagues too, 67% of the potential customers we surveyed prefer
to join a pick-up game when they have some free time.  Most of those
games are organized ad-hoc by a small number of people with the
initiative to book the field, spam their friends, and try to pull a game
together.

So what is the problem exactly?

![Home Screen](<{filename}/images/startupweekend/1.png> "gameIt application - Home Screen"){.pull-right}

It turns out that organizing a pick-up game is hard, so there aren’t as
many organizers as there should be. And as a player, finding a quick
local pick-up game is a hassle. You want to play with your friends, but
according to 82% of our survey respondents, they want to include others
as well - people they don't know yet, but share their passion for the
sport and play at the same skill level as themselves.

Our product is a software platform and mobile app that simplifies the
whole process. Effortlessly organize games, and have players discover &
join them in a single integrated experience. For that one game, you’re a
team - share, communicate, trash talk, all on the platform. And after
the game, keep the conversation going, or even set a re-match. When it’s
over, the team dissolves and you do it again next time.

![Search Screen](<{filename}/images/startupweekend/2.png> "gameIt app - Search for a Pick-up Game"){.pull-right}
We will monetize through advertising partnerships with local sports
retailers, who can deliver advertising to a qualified and captive
audience, right in the app. Imagine the power of an ad for soccer gear
that is delivered to someone that is fully engaged in a process to sign
up for a soccer game.

After the game, you'll find promotions from local hospitality vendors
that will help you take this new retro-social group down the street for
a beer.

As for a ramp plan, this is all about market capture to start.  The app
is free, and we will go city to city to work with community game
organizers to help them adopt the platform, with a goal of launching in
one Canadian city per week for the first 3 months. Once each city hits
critical mass, we will engage sponsors to increase reach and drive
revenue.  We estimate this method will drive the virility required to
reach millions of users within a year.

![View Game](<{filename}/images/startupweekend/3.png> "gameIt app - View Game"){.pull-right}

In the future, we have a bigger vision - we’ll help get people outside,
get healthy, and remember what social used to mean. We think that
individuals, brands, sponsors, sports fields and even government
programs like Participaction align to this ideal. Once we hit critical
mass, we envision a pro version with a monthly fee, and more value added
services like managed games, or even managed leagues, that remove the
organizer role altogether.

We want a healthier Canada, and we want to help  20 million Canadians
make pick-up games as effortless as ordering a pizza. We all know it
would be a much better choice.

What I Learned
--------------

First off, I have to say that the entire experience was wonderful.  Some
of the key lessons I took away were:

-   **Manage your time.**  We ran into crunch time at the end, with key
    elements of our pitch and the associated slides coming together way
    too late on Sunday.  As a regular speaker, I know the level of
    quality I can deliver - and this one wasn't my best.  Another 2
    hours of prep time would have made a world of difference.
-   **Have an elevator pitch.**  As the weekend progressed, we had to
    introduce the concept to many people who had no idea what we were up
    to.  They wanted to "get it" immediately.  They needed to understand
    the target market, value proposition & business model in 15 seconds,
    so they could quickly categorize us and make an assessment.  It had
    to be a strong hook that invited more exploration and discussion.
-   **Talk about the business, not the app.**  Not surprisingly, the
    technical people loved to talk about stacks & features.  However,
    there was zero interest in that from the big players - they wanted
    to see a competent team, a great business plan, and a vision that
    would create a company, not an app.
-   **Get lots of input, but then make your own decisions.**  With so
    much smart feedback from billiant and accomplished people, it's
    tempting to try and wedge it all into your solution.  However, you
    risk creating a Frankenstein solution that is a little bit of
    everything, and a whole lot of nothing.  The team needs to have a
    clear vision, understand their market, and produce a great business
    plan, and then lean on advisors to improve it - but don't take a
    hard left turn on a whim.

In Summary
----------

Unfortunately, we didn't win the competition, but the weekend was a huge
win.  We made some new friends, sharpened our skills, and had an
opportunity to learn what's really possible in 54 short hours when a
team has a vision & the commitment to make it happen.

Will we take gameIt to market?  Well, the team sure seems eager to
continue the work, and we have a huge head start.  We decided to take a
few days to decompress and then talk about it.
