[dropcap style="1" size="3"]I[/dropcap]T projects, like any other
investment, happen because the business has a driver - it may be to
reduce cost, increase capacity, improve productivity, avoid risk,
improve the customer experience, or for countless other reasons.

When I talk to clients about what they need from an IT solution, this is
where I like to start - with the business objective.  We explore the
core reasons for the investment, and the expected outcome.  I also like
to go through a "future picture" exercise, where we talk through the
changed business as if the job were done, imagining what is different,
how things changed, what we like & don't like about the outcome.  We
also run the numbers - how MUCH more productive are we, how MUCH has
cost been reduced?

### The combination of this future picture narrative with a quantifiable expectation of the impact is a powerful expectation setter - we're locked on what we're trying to achieve.

From there, we build a plan to achieve the outcome.  Everything about
this plan needs to tie back to the business objective, and directly link
to our desired outcome.  This can be an interesting process - and often
an iterative one - as the future picture is refined along with the
solution planning.  It is likely that non-IT elements will play an
important role as well - things like process improvements, employee
training, partner readiness, change management - all critical aspects of
a whole, effective solution.

Think about your IT projects.  If you're talking about software,
vendors, integration, licenses, etc - it should be within the context of
a clear set of *business* objectives and a specific future picture.
 Otherwise, you might be caught in a typical IT-project trap, where
technology rules and an expected business outcome is optional.
