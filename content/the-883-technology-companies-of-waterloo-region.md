Are you interested in Waterloo Region technology companies?  Are you
building your network or looking for a career change, and need a list?

If you read an earlier post about [how to plug in to Waterloo’s start-up
ecosystem](http://www.jeffsidea.com/2013/08/30/how-to-plug-in-to-waterloos-start-up-ecosystem/),
I referenced an [annual list of all technology companies in the
region](http://www.therecord.com/community-story/3840199-technology-directory/),
published by The [Record](http://www.therecord.com/waterlooregion/).   A
challenge with that list was the format - it wasn't easy to import into
a network management tool like
[JibberJobber](http://www.jibberjobber.com/), or even into Excel.

Well, let me make it easier for you.  This list of the [883 waterloo
tech
companies](http://www.jeffsidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WaterlooTechCompanies.csv),
courtesy of the Record, can be downloaded and imported as a CSV into
your favorite career management software.

Enjoy!
