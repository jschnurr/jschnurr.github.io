Recently, I was reading a great post by Ben McConnell over at Church of
the Customer entitled [Create a 1-page strategic
plan.](http://www.churchofcustomer.com/2009/12/how-to-create-a-1page-strategic-plan.html) I
was struck by the sheer simplicity of the concept, and reflected back to
countless strategic plan documents I’ve worked on or seen in my career
and wondered if they could be digested as easily as the one-pager Ben
advocates.  It’s a great example of the elegance in simplicity.

We all make decisions and set priorities within a context – a sort of
mental map that tells us where we are, where we’re going, and how we’ll
get there.  In our minds, this map unfolds so we can see the big
picture, and there is a big “you are here” pin stuck at the coordinates
of our current position.  All navigation (those decisions and
priorities) are made relative to that pin.

Have a look at that thick strategy document you’ve written and see if
you can make it into a map.  It will help everybody on your team
navigate.
