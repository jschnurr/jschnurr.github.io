you've ever worked with a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system,
you'll know that it helps a business manage their customers - everything
about the customer & your interactions with them, all in one place.
 Now, there is a version of that for your personal network - welcome
LinkedIn Contacts.  Sachin Rekhi from LinkedIn recently blogged about it
[here.](http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/04/25/introducing-the-new-linkedin-contacts-a-smarter-way-to-stay-in-touch-slideshow/)

It's been rolling out slowly, and just appeared for me last week.  I
must say, I'm very impressed.  In addition to GMail contacts
synchronization, you can take notes on people you find on LinkedIn (even
if you're not connected to them yet), and have them stored privately.
 This is a super handy location to keep meeting notes, follow-up actions
(for which you can set a reminder), or other useful facts such as their
birthday or the names of their kids.  Each subsequent interaction can be
more rich & informed by prior interactions.

In addition, LinkedIn uses your synchronization sources to put together
a view of who you've talked to recently - and who you haven't.  Use this
to remind yourself to reach out to people you haven't connected with
lately - keep in touch!

Check it out.  If you're into networking (and you should be!), it's a
great tool to step up your game.
