few years ago, I visited a small town outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma for a
customer meeting.

It was during the summer, and the tornado season in full swing.  Over
lunch, I learned a lot from the locals about the alert system they
depend on for their safety - huge, outdoor [tornado
sirens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren) activated by
the national weather service.

They're designed to be heard over the long distances of a rural
countryside, and every home and business knows what to do when they're
activated.  There are even regular tests to keep them top of mind and
familiar.

On one hand, it surprised me that the basic warning technique had not
changed in 80 years, since "air raid sirens" warned of imminent attack.
 However, I also wondered what other option could provide the same
reliable service to people within a certain geographic footprint,
regardless of whether they live there or are just passing through?

Today, smart phones have enabled a better option - the [Wireless
Emergency Alert
System](http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/safety/index.cfm/AID/12082) is
a federally sponsored (in the US) program, supported by all of the major
mobile carriers, that sends emergency messages to all mobile phones
within a certain geographic area.  The messages must come from a short
list of approved senders, and are given network priority to ensure they
arrive even if your local cell tower is congested.  It's a modern-day
tornado siren, complete with an explanation for the warning and short
instructions on what you need to do.

The program has just [launched this
year](http://www.informationweek.com/government/mobile/wireless-emergency-alert-system-goes-liv/240002942),
and other countries are in a similar phase of early rollout of similar
systems.  Given the life saving potential and relatively low costs
(riding existing networks), I think the chances are good that, within
the next 5 years, most jurisdictions will be able to warn their
community of danger, even if they don't have a siren.[/fusion\_text]
