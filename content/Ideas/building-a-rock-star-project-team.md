In professional hockey, teams have a General Manager (GM) and a Coach
charged with one mission - put a team on the ice that is both capable
and driven to deliver a truly exceptional outcome - the Stanley Cup.
 Every factor must be considered individually and then again as a whole,
to arrive at a perfect mix of talent that can produce under a variety of
possible future scenarios.  Strategies are selected, trade-offs are
made, deals are cut - and when it comes time to deliver, the outcome is
broadcast live on national TV.

In contrast, we often take a vanilla "resource management" approach to
putting our project teams together.  Too often the project manager is
dealing with seemingly interchangeable "resource types", drawn from a
pool, putting names in boxes on a project plan to reach a resourcing
milestone and keep things on track.  The whole process is sterile and
misses the key point that every GM and coach knows intuitively - the way
the team works *together* is more important than their *individual
capabilities*.  Exceptional outcomes require exceptional teamwork - a
product of good team selection and great coaching that aligns everyone
to the goal.

So how can we improve the approach and get the rock-star team and the
exceptional results we all want?  In my experience putting together
dozens of teams with hundreds of people over the years, there are 4 key
ingredients.

1.  **Appoint a GM**.  One person, accountable to the project sponsor,
    needs to take accountability for putting the right team together.
     This usually has to be done informally, as most organizations
    decentralize control of resource selection for project assignment.
     With due respect to the highly talented project managers out there,
    this isn't a PM's expertise, and there is too much conflict with
    other project needs.  Formally or informally, this needs to be a
    savvy leader that can gain the trust and respect of the team, sniff
    out egos, agendas and conflicts, and draw in top talent that fits
    together as a team.  Bonus if the project sponsor can play this
    role.
2.  **Ask HR for help.**  If the resources are internal, ask your HR
    department for "scouting reports" and feedback that will help
    determine how an individual will contribute to the overall dynamic.
     This is the kind of work done routinely as hiring decisions for
    permanent positions are made, and you might find that the ability to
    determine "team fit" is transferable to temporary project teams.
3.  **Make mid-season trades.**  Often, as projects evolve and shift
    into a new phase, the dynamics of the team change.  There may have
    also been errors in the original selection that need to be
    corrected.  In any case, make player selection an iterative process,
    constantly revisiting the actual performance vs the expectation, and
    making necessary trades.
4.  **Coach the team as one.**  Large projects have many functions,
    often across organizations, offices and functions.  To truly get the
    alignment, the team must come together regularly to understand the
    strategy and status; not just for project deliverables, but for the
    dynamics and expectations amongst different team members.  Everyone
    needs clarity on what their position is, how it relates to the other
    positions, and how it contributes to the higher level objective.

For some of you, this topic may seem a little "squishy", like an luxury
when we've got projects to execute.  If you're feeling that way, I ask
you to think about the best project team you've ever been part of - the
one that was the most energized, committed, and capable, and delivered
results beyond expectations.  Ask yourself, how did that particular
group come together?  What was it about the dynamics that made it so
special?   Was it just random luck that put *that* group of people
together for *that* project?  Or was there a GM and a coach at work
helping create the conditions for success?

Go build a rock-star team.  Exceptional results are so much more fun.
