Over the past year, my team has been developing a process to link dozens
of different business functions together. The goal is to see that every
group is invoked as and when they're needed, supplied with all of the
right inputs, and allowed time to make their value contribution before
handing off to the next step in the process.

Once built and stabilized, this systematic 'machine' will stamp out
instances with increasing consistency and quality, and the business will
have ample control and insight to tune the performance of the overall
system. It's a massive act of choreography, but there is a lot of
invention required too - we need documents, templates, control gates,
governance systems, prioritization schemes, resource management etc -
all of the elements that bring a process to life, and make it tangible
and concrete.

It strikes me that this sounds a lot like software development. Good
software design brings not only a certain order to things, but it
manages information as it flows through the system, calls subroutines or
system functions with the right parameters to invoke some required
operation, and uses the results for the next logical operation - all in
service to some greater end-user goal. Each function may operate in
isolation while contributing to the larger system. The programmer can
instrument the code to provide useful performance and tuning data, which
can help improve the performance of future iterations of the software.

So, what can we draw from this insight? In the DevOps space, I wonder if
the process-heavy Ops folks could get some "cred" with the coders by
describing their processes in software design terms. For process design,
I wonder if the principles and techniques of software design could help
us build more robust, reusable and efficient processes?

In any case, my mental map of this big process we're building is
improved when I think about it in code. I'm not sure why, but I'm going
to work with it for a bit and see what happens.
