I think most of us are vulnerable to viewing the world through a
particular lens. When out for dinner, a firefighter scans the restaurant
for the exits, a chef critiques the preparation and presentation of the
meal, and the doctor reflects on the health of the server. Our world
view and profile of interest in any topic or situation is defined by
that lens.

Professionally, how is this impacting your work every day? Have you
become so one dimensional and predictable that your question or
contribution to every conversation can be predicted in advance? Are you
the “cost guy”, the “scalability guy” or the lady obsessed with vendor
contract terms?

To be at your best, challenge yourself to change the lens. Ignore your
role, level, specialty, department – and look at the topic objectively.
Surprise your colleagues by asking insightful and important questions
from a perspective you don’t normally represent. Ask yourself how
someone with a different lens would look at this. Even better, ask how a
customer would look at it. In so doing, you’ll demonstrate that your
primary interest is in the overall betterment of the business, and not
in bolstering the perceived value of your own little world.

The people that really make a difference excel at this. Their lens is a
tool, but it doesn’t constrain their thinking. Try a different lens –
you might be surprised.
