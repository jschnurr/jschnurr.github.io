Since 2006, my blog has always been a bit of a science project - a way
to learn **about** the blogging platform, but without a commitment to
regular content.  Now, with my career moving in a different direction,
I'm placing more priority on this creative outlet as a way to more
actively participate in the online community.

On the technology side, I've upgraded to
[Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/ "Wordpress"), moved the blog to
[Bluehost](http://www.bluehost.com/ "Bluehost"), and got a fancy new
theme from
[Solostream](http://www.solostream.com/wordpress-themes/wp-professional/).
 A huge upgrade from my old site on Blogspot!

So what can you expect me to blog about?  Three things primarily:

1.  The Start-up ecosystem.  I plan to deeply engage in the Waterloo
    Start-up community.  There is such a rich and wonderful support
    system in and around Waterloo, supporting hundreds of exciting new
    ventures - my intent is to get wired in, and seek opportunities to
    get more involved.  I'll share aspects of my journey here.
2.  Business & Technology practices.  Having implemented & operated so
    many IT systems over the years, there are many experiences worth
    sharing.  Some will sound like tips or best practices, and some may
    serve as an example of what not to do!
3.  Service & Support.  I have a real passion for customer service and
    technical support.  We'll explore some of the tools & practices that
    provide the leading customer experiences in the market today.

I encourage you to sign up for updates, either via email or RSS (you'll
find both in the footer at the bottom of this page), and to participate
in the conversation.   Thanks!
