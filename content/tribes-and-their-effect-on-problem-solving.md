Before solving a problem, have you considered the type of problem you're
solving?   What happens if you get the type wrong?

[Nancy
Roberts](http://faculty.nps.edu/vitae/cgi-bin/vita.cgi?p=display_vita&id=1023567844)
outlined three types of problems in her paper [Wicked Problems and
Network Approaches to
Resolution](http://www3.imp.unisg.ch/org/idt/ipmr.nsf/0/1f3bcad88f16e7c6c1256c76004be2c4/%24FILE/IPMR_1_1_WICHED.pdf):

-   **Type 1 - Simple Problems.**  There is a consensus on the problem
    definition and solution.  Think about a mechanical breakdown, for
    example - the pump is failing, causing low pressure.  Replace the
    pump, problem solved.
-   **Type 2 - Complex Problems.**  Consensus exists on the what the
    problem is, but there are many possible causes and opinions vary
    amongst problem solvers.  For example, the local school scores
    poorly on standardized testing.  Is it the curriculum, the teachers,
    student apathy, or a bad sample caused by an illness that swept
    through the school the week of the test?
-   **Type 3 - Wicked Problems**.  High level of conflict between
    stakeholders, and no consensus on what 'the problem' is, nor what
    the solution might be.  Examples typically require a large number of
    people to change their mindset and behaviour, such as in economic,
    environmental or political issues.

Each type has a very different set of problem solving tools, and knowing
the type will lead you to the right one.  However, get the type wrong
and your best application of a great tool will still lead to poor
results.

I think there are more 'wicked' problems out there than most people
realize, going misdiagnosed and frustrating the problem solvers who keep
applying their best methods without results.  My hypothesis is that
problem solvers will often perceive wicked problems as Type 1 or 2,
because their 'tribe' (organizational unit, social group or affiliation)
share a world view that drives local consensus.  That prevents a wider
perspective that would identify the true extent of the conflict across
tribes, and creates the false perception that 'the problem' is widely
agreed and understood.

To understand whether you're really dealing with a wicked problem, one
must look to other tribes for a different perspective.  Once identified
as a wicked problem, the tribes can come together to approach it
together, with full knowledge of what they're dealing with.  Too often,
misdiagnosis leads to one tribe solving 'their' problem, while a
different manifestation of the same wicked problem pops up somewhere
else.  It's an endless game of whack-a-mole which, if not diagnosed and
addressed, can continue unrestrained.

Take a look at the problems you're solving today.  Are you sure you have
the type right?
