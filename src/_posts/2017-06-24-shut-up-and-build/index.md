Do you have a Mr. or Ms. _No_ in your company? You know, the one who has an opinion and
lots of ideas, but is constantly stuck in the concept stage? Thriving on policies and process,
they live for the reasons why things **can't** happen. They produce lots of paper and meetings,
and little else.

At the other end of the spectrum, you'll find the _cowboy_. They push too much too fast,
alienating people and triggering defenses. They leave a debris trail a mile long,
and don't get much accomplished either.

So how do you get things done?

Try building a _prototype_. Make it ugly, half-baked, impractical, and full of assumptions.

Why? There is something magical about putting your ideas out into the world, in a concrete format
that we can reason about. It's provocative and curious. Is it real? Should I take it
seriously? Do I like it?

The _No_ people can reason that it's just a toy, and play along. The _cowboys_ feel it's
unconventional enough to be cool, and hey, at least we're doing stuff. The conversation shifts
from the abstract to the concrete, and suddenly we're talking about improving on something that
already exists.

Now, don't get too attached to the prototype, because it won't last long. The good judgement and rigor
of a proper methodology will produce something entirely different, once play-time is over.

But that's ok. In fact, it's the whole point. The prototype just lights the fuse. Once we blast
off from concept-land, we can solve the problem as a team. Magic.
